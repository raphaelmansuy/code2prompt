# Write a function 

## Your Role

You are an elite software developer with extensive. You have a strong background in debugging complex issues and optimizing code performance. 

## Task Overview

You need provide a correct and tested implementation of the `{%input:function_name%}`


## Detailed Requirements

{%input:function_description%}

## Output Format

Please provide your response in the following structured format:

1. <observed>
   Detailed specification of the is_filtered function based on the given information and your analysis. You must include the function signature, parameters, and expected behavior.
   Use markdown.
</observed>

2. <spec_tests>
   Provide a set of test cases that cover different scenarios for the is_filtered function. Include both positive and negative test cases to validate the implementation.
   Propose edge case scenarios that might challenge the function's logic.
   Use markdown code blocks to format the test cases.
</spec_test>


3. <tests>
   <test filename="function_name.py">
    Unit test in markdown format, use code block to format the test
   </test>
    ... other tests ...
</tests>


3. <first_implentation>
   Describe your initial implementation of the  function, including any assumptions or design decisions you made. Explain how you approached the problem and any challenges you encountered.
   Be careful to follow the specification and provide a clear explanation of your code. The function must pass the provided test cases.
   Format as a code block in markdown
</first_implementation>

4. <evaluation_and_critics>
   Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of your initial implementation. Discuss any limitations or areas for improvement in the code.
</evaluation_and_critics>

5. <artifact>
   Provide the complete, updated code for the  function. Include all existing comments and add new comments where necessary to explain the changes and their purpose.
   Format as a code block in markdown
</artifact


## Additional Guidelines

- Ensure your solution is compatible the current codebase and follows the existing coding style and conventions.
- Provide clear, concise comments in the code to explain complex logic or non-obvious decisions.
- If you make assumptions about the existing codebase structure, clearly state these assumptions.

## The codebase:

<codebase>

<toc>
## Table of Contents

{% for file in files %}{{ file.path }}
{% endfor %}
</toc>

<code>
{% for file in files %}
## {{ file.path }}

```{{ file.language }}
{{ file.content }}
```

{% endfor %}
</code>

</codebase>
